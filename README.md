# FAQ Accordion

This is my solution to the FAQ Accordion challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Overview

In this project, I built a FAQ accordion, a widely used front-end pattern that displays frequently asked questions with collapsible answers. The project allowed me to practice building interactive and responsive components using modern front-end tools.

## Features

- A fully functional FAQ accordion with expand/collapse toggle functionality.
- Plus and minus SVG icons for toggling.
- Fully responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile screens.
- Implemented with React, Vite, and shadcn/ui for the accordion UI components.

## Prerequisites
- npm (or Yarn) 
- npm create vite@latest  

## Installation

```

3. Install dependencies :

```bash

This will start the development server, and your project will be accessible at http://localhost:5173. 

5. Building for production :
